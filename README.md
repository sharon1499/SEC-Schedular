# Introduction

The concept for this project was conceived previous to recognition of problems within Columbus State's own room reservation system. It was noted that some issues a user might face when navigating said source included being confused by location or available resources to given spaces. 

For this project, we have developed a room reservation schedular that amends these issues. Within our system, the user is able to view a building's reservable spaces, select an available space, and place a request of reservation. 

A live link to our project can be viewed [here](https://sec-schedulars.herokuapp.com/).
